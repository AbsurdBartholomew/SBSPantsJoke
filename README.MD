This repository is the source code to a very rushed (about 1-2 hours of work total) April Fools joke.
I spread it around in a few places claiming that it's the debug build of the "recently located" final source code to SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge GBA.

There are no dependencies other than libgba (from devkitPro).
